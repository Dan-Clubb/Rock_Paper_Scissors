# Rock - Paper - Scissors

A single player rock paper scissors game where you play against the computer.

This is the console version of the game 05/072021

What I learnt:
 
 - how to use multiple functions together
 - how to break down a project into smaller achievable tasks
 - how randomly pick a number
